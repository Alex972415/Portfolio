# Final project, Part 1: Segmentation of mobile app users
## Project Description
We work in the team of the service "Unnecessary things" - applications for the sale of unnecessary things.
The company's motto is "Unnecessary things" â€” someone else needs your unnecessary things!
In this project, we need to choose a method for segmenting users, divide users into segments depending on their behavior, select a target segment of users for which the application will then be improved. Also, during project we will check two hypothesis to test the behavior of users who came from different advertising sources and provide recommendations on product's improvement.
## Skills and tools
- python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- scipy
## Conclusions
- Segmentation was performed by the duration of the user's stay in the application. In total, 4 segments were allocated. 
    * Segment_1 - session less than 10 minutes
    * Segment_2 - session from 10 to 20 minutes
    * Segment_3 - session from 20 to 30 minutes
    * Segment_4 - session of 30 minutes or more
- There is no fundamental difference between the segments in the context of retention.
- The fourth segment shows a much better conversion rate than the others.
- It was proposed to define the fourth segment as the target.
- It cannot be said that Yandex and Google users demonstrate different conversions to the target action.
- It cannot be concluded that Yandex users spend more time in the application than Google users.
## Recommendations that can be given for the development of the application:
1. Give discount promo codes to users from the target segment for the second or third purchase. In my opinion, if a user spends a lot of time in the app, then you can expect that he will make more than one purchase, respectively, so I suggest encouraging users to make more purchases.
2. Considering that it is now November 5, 2019, on the eve of the New Year, you can select a list of users who have completed the most targeted actions or purchases and send out gift certificates to increase customer loyalty of the target segment and save them in 2020.
3. You can analyze the first segment and try to identify the reasons why users spend little time in the application.
4. Users from the first segment should be given a promo code for the first purchase. Perhaps this will increase their interest in the application.
5. In anticipation of the most active hours (from 14 to 15 and from 19 to 21 hours), set up contextual advertising in Google and Yandex to attract users to the application.
