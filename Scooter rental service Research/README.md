# Research of scooter rental service
## Project Description
In this project, we will analyze the data of the popular scooter rental service Go Fast. We were given data about some users from several cities, as well as about their trips.
To travel around the city, users of the GoFast service use a mobile application. The service can be used: without a subscription, or with an Ultra subscription.
We will try to analyze subscription data and test some hypotheses that can help the business grow.
