# Sales funnel research and decision-making based on A/A/B tests
## Project Description
We work in a startup that sells food. We need to figure out how the users of our mobile application behave.
Let's study the sales funnel. After that, we will investigate the results of the A/A/B experiment.
Designers wanted to change fonts throughout the application, and managers were afraid that users would be unusual.
We agreed to make a decision based on the results of the A/A/B test. Users were divided into 3 groups: 2 control ones with old fonts and one experimental one with new ones.
Let's find out which font is better.
## Skills and tools
- python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- plotly
- numpy
- scipy
- z-test
## Conclusions
- It was calculated what proportion of users passes for each next step of the funnel. We found out that most of the users are lost at the OffersScreenAppear step
- It was calculated that 48% of users reach the payment from the first event.
- An A/A test was conducted to make sure that the splitting of users into groups was performed correctly.
- During the A/B test, it was found out that the new font did not affect user behavior in any way.
