Christina Costa goes beyond the \"fight\" narrative of cancer -- or any formidable personal journey -- to highlight the brain benefits of an empowering alternative to fostering resilience in the face of unexpected challenges: gratitude.   \n",

       "3                                              One could argue that slang words like ‘hangry,’ ‘defriend’ and ‘adorkable’ fill crucial meaning gaps in the English language, even if they don't appear in the dictionary. After all, who actually decides which words make it into those pages? Language historian Anne Curzan gives a charming look at the humans behind dictionaries, and the choices they make.   \n",

Anthropologist Rebecca Galemba explores the multibillion-dollar problem of wage theft and how employers get away with it, highlighting the changes needed for them to pay up -- and fairly.   \n",

In this hilarious, fast-paced, and insightful talk, the magazine's longstanding cartoon editor and self-proclaimed \"humor analyst\" Bob Mankoff dissects the comedy within just some of the \"idea drawings\" featured in the magazine, explaining what works, what doesn't, and why.   \n",

But as Esther Perel argues, good and committed sex draws on two conflicting needs: our need for security and our need for surprise. So how do you sustain desire?

    "# Project conclusions:\n",
    "1. Performances took place most often in the USA and Canada\n",
    "2. The most popular categories are science, technology, culture, society.\n",
    "3. In 2020-2021, the number of speeches decreased sharply (apparently due to the coronavirus epidemic), the science and culture categories ceased to be popular, and the popularity of the global issues and society categories increased significantly.\n",
    "4. Science, culture, technology, - the most popular categories\n",
