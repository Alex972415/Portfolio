# Research of patterns that determine the success of games
## Project Description
We work in the online store "Streamchik", which sells computer games all over the world. Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources. 
We need to make portraits of users, identify patterns that determine the success of the game, and test the corresponding hypotheses. 
This will allow you to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.
