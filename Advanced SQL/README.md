# Advanced SQL
## Project Description
A project of 20 tasks for compiling queries to the database (PostgreSQL) StackOverflow. StackOverflow is a service of questions and answers about programming. StackOverflow is similar to a social network â€” users of the service ask questions, answer posts, leave comments and rate other answers. During the project, we will consolidate our knowledge of basic skills in SQL and window functions.

## Skills and tools
- SQL
- PostgreSQL
- window functions
- temporary tables
- subqueries
- Python

## Conclusions
- To perform the tasks assigned, a connection to the database was made using SQLAlchemy.
