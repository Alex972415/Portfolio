# Analysis of business indicators of the application
## Project Description
We work in a company that owns the Procrastinate Pro+ entertainment application. Despite huge investments in advertising, the company has been suffering losses for the past few months. Our task is to understand the reasons and help the company to become a plus. There is data on users attracted from May 1 to October 27, 2019: server log with data about their visits, unloading of their purchases for this period, advertising expenses. We have to study: where users come from and what devices they use, how much it costs to attract users from various advertising channels; how much money does each client bring, when the costs of attracting a client pay off, what factors prevent attracting customers.

## Skills and tools

## Conclusions
- As part of the business plan, when users have to start paying off within 14 days, advertising does not pay off.
- Android, iPhone and Mac devices, AdNonSense, Faceboom and TipTop advertising sources have a negative impact on the payback of advertising, and the advertising company that takes place in the USA does not pay off either.
- The company in the USA did not pay off because of two channels: Faceboom and TipTop.
   TipTop - due to high advertising costs.
   Faceboom - due to low retention.
- In Europe, the company did not pay off in the AdNonSense channel, even despite the decrease in investments there with the progress of the advertising company.
- YRabbit, MediaTornado, lambdaMediaAds, LeapBob, RocketSuperAds channels showed the best payback rates.
